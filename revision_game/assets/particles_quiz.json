    "question": "Which subatomic particle has a relative charge of +1?",
    "options": [
      "Electron",
      "Proton",
      "Neutron",
      "Positron"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Protons carry +1, electrons −1, neutrons 0, positrons +1 but are antiparticles. The standard nucleus particle with +1 is the proton.",
    "difficulty": "Medium"

    "question": "What is the approximate size of an atom?",
    "options": [
      "1 nm",
      "0.1 nm",
      "1 μm",
      "10 nm"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Typical atomic radius is about 0.1 nm = 1×10⁻¹⁰ m.",

    "options": [
      "Different numbers of protons",
      "Different numbers of neutrons",
      "Different atomic numbers",
      "Different charges"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Isotopes share proton number but differ in neutron number.",

    "question": "Half‑life is…",
    "options": [
      "Time for activity to reach zero",
      "Time for activity to halve",
      "Time for all nuclei to decay",
      "Time for count rate to double"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Half‑life is the time for the number of undecayed nuclei (or activity) to halve.",
